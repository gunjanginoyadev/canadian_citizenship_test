The second test usually takes place 4 to 8 weeks after the first test, but it may be longer.\nIf you don’t pass your second test, they'll send you a notice telling you to attend a hearing with a citizenship official. The hearing:\n<li>will last 30 to 90 minutes</li>\n<li>may be in person or by videoconference</li>\n<li>may be used to assess one or more requirements for citizenship, for example, knowledge of Canada, and/or language</li>\n\nIf you don’t pass the test after 3 tries, they'll refuse your application.
