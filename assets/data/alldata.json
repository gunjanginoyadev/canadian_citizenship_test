The safety of the ballot is crucial, and the system ensures that it is not possible to determine which candidate a particular voter selected. Additionally, a vote submitted with a mark that might enable the voter to be recognized must be discarded.\nThis is to guarantee that no voters are coerced or bribed to cast their ballots in a specific manner. Threats and bribery, along with any effort to disclose how an elector has voted or plans to vote, constitute an offense under the Canada Elections Act.\nThe privacy of voters is also highly valued by Elections Canada, and this is upheld in every facet of electoral management. For instance, to uphold the right to privacy, the utilization of personal data collected for electoral reasons is carefully controlled.The privacy of voters is also highly valued by Elections Canada, and this is upheld in every facet of electoral management.

Canada's red and white flag, featuring its iconic maple leaf, is widely recognized worldwide.\n\n<h>Maple Leaf</h>\nThe Maple Leaf Tartan was officially designated as a national symbol on March 9, 2011, through a ministerial declaration.\nTartan is a fabric, typically composed of wool or cashmere, distinguished by its design of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines at right angles, displaying a variety of colors. Tartans are typically linked to Scotland and its different areas, clans, and families. Nowadays, tartans are frequently utilized to signify belonging to a family or a group.\nDesigned by Toronto businessman David Weiser in 1964, the Maple Leaf Tartan was crafted in expectation of the 100th anniversary of Confederation in 1967. Motivated by the hues of the maple leaf across the shifting seasons, the tartan's design blends the green of summer foliage, the gold of early fall, the red of the initial frost, and the brown shades of withered leaves prior to winter. The symbolism of the Maple Leaf Tartan emphasizes a unique feature of the Canadian landscape. Its name is also derived from another emblem that appeared in the mid-1960s: the National Flag of Canada, which showcases a stylized maple leaf.\nOn October 21, 2010, the Government of Canada announced that April 6 would be recognized as Tartan Day. Tartan Day festivities feature parades with pipe bands, traditional dancing, frequently influenced by Scottish heritage, alongside community events.\nA representation of national pride, the tartan was created to be donned by Canadians of diverse backgrounds, particularly on occasions like Canada Day (July 1) and Tartan Day (April 6).\n</text><questions type=\"ids\"></questions></lesson>",

It was designated as an official symbol of Canada on March 24, 1975, when the National Symbol of Canada Act was granted royal assent.\nThis legislation sought to highlight the beaver (castor canadensis) as a symbol of Canadian sovereignty.\nThe beaver was already an element of Canadian identity prior to the Act's adoption. For instance, in 1851, the beaver was highlighted prominently on Canada’s inaugural postage stamp. It was observed on the totem poles of Indigenous peoples along the Pacific coastline. In truth, the beaver was the initial widely recognized emblem of Canada, prior to the maple leaf.\nWell before European settlers arrived, Indigenous peoples acknowledged the significance and worth of the beaver. Its fur was utilized to create garments, and its bones were crafted into various tools. Its healthy flesh also rendered it a significant food source. Additionally, a substance released by its glands acted as an outstanding lure for other predatory species.\nRegardless of these attributes, the primary reason the beaver was designated as an official symbol of Canada is mainly due to its significant involvement in the fur trade that lasted from the 17th century to the mid-19th century. During this time, there was a strong demand for beaver pelts, which were particularly essential in producing the waterproof felt hats that were highly fashionable in Europe then. The presence of beavers in North America signified a significant commercial chance for Europeans, spurring the exploration and colonization that defined Canada's history.\nAlthough the fur trade significantly impacted Canada’s history, it also led to the near extinction of the beaver species. By the mid-19th century, the beaver was nearly extinct from the Canadian environment. Steps were taken to safeguard it, and as a result, its populations have flourished across the nation.\n</text><questions type=\"ids\"></questions></lesson>",
