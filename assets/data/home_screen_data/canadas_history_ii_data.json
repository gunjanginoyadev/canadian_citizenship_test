The United States believed it would be easy to conquer Canada, and so they attacked Canada in June 1812.\n\nCanada was not easy to conquer. In 1813, there were naval battles on the Great Lakes. This means that there was fighting between ships. The Canadian warship called the HMS Shannon captured the United States warship called the USS Chesapeake and brought it into Halifax harbour in Nova Scotia.\n\nWhen the Americans invaded Canada between 1812 and 1814, Canadian volunteers and First Nations people supported the British soldiers as they defended Canada. \nChief Tecumseh was an Aboriginal person who helped to defend Canada when Canada was fighting against the United States. He was from the Aboriginal group called Shawnee. The French-Canadian militiamen also helped to defend Canada during this war.\n\nMajor-General Sir Isaac Brock captured the city of <b>Detroit</b>, but was later killed near Niagara Falls. In 1813, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles de Salaberry and 460 soldiers (mostly French-speaking Canadiens) stopped 4,000 American soldiers who were trying to invade Canada near Montreal.</text><questions type=\"ids\">153,154,155,156</questions></lesson>",
