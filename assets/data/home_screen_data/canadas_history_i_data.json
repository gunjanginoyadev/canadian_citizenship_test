The first European explorers to arrive thought that they had reached the East Indies. The native people lived off the land. Some hunted and gathered food, and others raised crops.\n\nThe native groups called the Cree, and the Dene, who lived in the northwest part of Canada, were hunter-gatherers.\nThe native group called the Iroquois hunted and farmed.\nThe groups of natives called the Sioux were nomadic, and followed the buffalo (bison) herd.\nThe Inuit lived by eating the animals in the Arctic.\nThe natives on the West Coast (British Columbia today) ate fish. They preserved the fish by drying and smoking it.\n\nMany Aboriginal groups had to compete for land and resources, and they often went to war against each other.\n\n<image url=\"https://wisdom.reev.ca/images/app-3/Canada-History-I/Aboriginal-Peoples/1.jpeg\">Pow Wow Membertou 400 Celebration Halifax Nova Scotia Grand Entry.

The first movement to stop slavery started in the British Parliament in the late 1700s. \n\nIn 1793, Lieutenant Governor <b>John Graves Simcoe</b> helped Upper Canada to make the decision to stop slavery. Upper Canada became the first province in the Empire to start the movement of stopping slavery. \n\nHe was a Loyalist military officer and the <b>first Lieutenant Governor of Canada</b>. He was also the founder of the city of York, which is now called <b>Toronto.</b>\n\n<image url=\"https://wisdom.reev.ca/images/app-3/Canada-History-I/Abolition-of-Slavery/1.png\">Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.</image>\n\n<h>Underground Railroad</h>\nIn 1807, the British parliament made it illegal to buy and sell slaves. In 1833, slavery was abolished in the entire British Empire.\n\nThousands of slaves escaped from the United States (where slavery was legal) to Canada. They did so by escaping at night and looking up at the stars to follow the <b>North Star</b> to travel north to Canada.\n\nPeople who didn’t agree with slavery helped the slaves by hiding them in their homes as they travelled north out of the United States. This way of escape was called the <b>Underground Railroad.</b>\n\nMary Ann (Shadd) Carey wanted to end slavery in the United States. She was the first woman publisher in Canada. She was the publisher of a weekly newspaper called <b>The Provincial Freeman</b>. This newspaper had information about how to stop slavery. It also encouraged people to drink less alcohol and to obey British laws.</text><questions type=\"ids\">1145,1146,1147,1148,1149</questions></lesson>",
