Adolf Hitler, the Nazi dictator of Germany, invaded Poland and conquered most of Europe. More than <b>one million Canadians and Newfoundlanders</b> served in the Second World War.

More Canadians died in Dieppe in France in 1942.\n\n<b>The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF)</b> was in the Battle of Britain and helped the <b>Allies</b> fight the war. Over 130,000 Allied aircrew were trained in Canada under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.\n\n<image url=\"https://wisdom.reev.ca/images/app-3/Canada-History-III/World-War-II/1.png\">Three Spitfires, with RCAF markings visible, flying over France.

Canada’s Merchant Navy helped Britain with food, clothing, and supplies. At the end of the Second World War, Canada had the third-largest navy in the world.\n\n<h>Japan in World War II</h>\nJapan was part of the group of countries in World War II that were against Canada. As a result, Japanese Canadians who lived in BC were treated as enemies. They were forced to sell their property and live somewhere else. In other words, they were relocated without a choice. In 1988, the government of Canada apologized to the Japanese Canadians for this action. Japan surrendered on <b>August 14, 1945.</b>\n\n<b>This is the end of the History chapter series.
