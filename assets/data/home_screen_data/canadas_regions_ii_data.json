The Gold Rush is the name for the time in which many people hurried (rushed) to go north to try to get rich from the gold in the Yukon. Robert W. Service is a poet who wrote about this. Mining is an important part of the economy.\n\nIn 1900, the railway called <b>The White Pass and Yukon Railway</b> opened from Skagway (in <b>Alaska</b>, which is an American state beside Yukon) to Whitehorse. <b>Whitehorse</b> is the capital of Yukon. Many tourists like to take this railway.\n\n<image url=\"https://wisdom.reev.ca/images/app-3/Canada-Regions-II/The-North-II/1.png\">Yukon Territory, Canada. Photo: Kalen Emsley.</image>\n\nYukon has the <b>coldest temperature</b> ever recorded in Canada (-63 degrees C).\n\n<b>Mount Logan</b> is located in the Yukon. It is the highest mountain in Canada. It is named after Sir William Logan. He was a world-famous Canadian geologist. He founded and directed the Geological Survey of Canada from 1842 to 1869.\n\n<h>The Northwest Territories</h>\nThe Northwest Territories were originally made up in 1870, using land from <b>Rupert’s land</b>. Rupert’s land was land that drained into the Hudson’s Bay, and which the Hudson's Bay Company used for 200 years from 1670 to 1870.\n\nThe capital of the Northwest Territories is <b>Yellowknife</b>. It has a population of 20,000 and is called the <b>diamond capital of North America</b>.\n\n<image url=\"https://wisdom.reev.ca/images/app-3/Canada-Regions-II/The-North-II/2.png\">Mackenzie River, Northwest Territories, Canada. Photo: Alan Emery.</image>\n\nMore than half of the population in the Northwest Territories is <b>Aboriginal</b> (Dene, Inuit, Métis).\n\nThe <b>Mackenzie River</b> is the second-longest river system in North America. (The Mississippi River in the US is longer.)\n\n<h>Nunavut</h>\nNunavut means <b>our land</b> in Inuktitut. It was established in 1999. The capital is Iqaluit, which used to be called Frobisher Bay. Frobisher Bay was named after the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who went into the Arctic in 1576.\n\n<image url=\"https://wisdom.reev.ca/images/app-3/Canada-Regions-II/The-North-II/3.png\">Pangnirtung Fijord, Nunavut, Canada.

They choose a premier and ministers by consensus.\n\nThe population is about <b>85% Inuit.</b> <b>Inuktitut</b> is an official language and the first language in schools.</text><questions type=\"ids\">1326,1327,1328,1329,1330,1331,1332,1333,1334,1335,1336</questions></lesson>",
