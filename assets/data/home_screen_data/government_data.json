Benoit Debaix.</image>\n\nThere are <b>three important facts</b> about Canada’s system of government:\n\n<b>Canada is a federal state</b>\nThe federal government has different responsibilities than the provinces. There is a national government and legislature for general purposes, with local governments and legislatures for local purposes. Federalism lets the provinces decide what is best for their people. It gives the provinces a chance to try different ideas.\n\n<b>Canada is a parliamentary democracy</b>\nThis means that citizens in Canada can vote in democratic elections. In a democratic election, the person or group which gets more than 50% of the vote can make decisions for the whole group. In other words, they can represent the group. The representatives go to parliament to make laws.\n\n<b>Canada is a constitutional monarchy</b>\nThis means that the monarch (king or queen) has rights, duties, and responsibilities for a country. The constitution of Canada gives information about what the monarch (king or queen) will do for Canada.</text><questions type=\"ids\">1212,1213</questions></lesson>",
